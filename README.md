# flutter_exam

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

State Management: GetX

To run the app using Flavor you can use the command

flutter run lib/main_development.dart
flutter run lib/main_staging.dart
flutter run lib/main_production.dart

Or if you use VsCode you just simply click the Icon Play Button (Ctrl+Shift+D) in the left corner top and you have a choice of what environment you want to run.

After successfully running the project you see the Splash Screen and then the main page which has a button gets a random string and button reset.
